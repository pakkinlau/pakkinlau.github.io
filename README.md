## Work In Progress


Candidate webpage: 
1.  https://veedata.github.io/publications/
I love its progress bar in the main bar. But I don't like its project page. It is better to be list view instead of grid view.
Resume page is useless because I already have linkedin.

2. https://lbugnon.github.io/publicaciones
I love its list view associating with a picture, in his publication page.
